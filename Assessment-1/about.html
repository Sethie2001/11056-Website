                    Contour 556 is the water level of Lake Burley Griffin, which links the event 
                    in name as well as in purpose to the history of the central Canberra
                    landscape. The artworks and installations selected for the festival
                    respond in some way to Canberra’s history, from 50,000 years to the 
                    present day. contour 556 will therefore offer the Canberra,
                    Australian and international community a unique opportunity
                    to engage with and understand the layers of Canberra’s history
                    through art.</td>
