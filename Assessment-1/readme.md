### Planning and low-fi Prototypes
The sketches above show the low-fi prototypes that drew up at the start of this assessment. These prototype show the basic layout I was aiming for the desgin of the website and when coming up with the desgin I look at many festival site and the way the desginer lay it out. I found from looking at these website that alot were quite similar in desgin and that the desginer were probaby trying to keep all the main deatil of the festival on one page.  
So when I was coming up with the prototype for page, I wanted to have alot the important stuff about the festival on the home page, for example I added the maps of the location to show where each artwork would be to user and add the date festival near the top to allow people to know when it is. When looking at website, some of them inclueded video in the top part of their home page and I throught this look like a good idea and it would show the user what the festival might look like.  
Some change that made from the prototype was removing the artist page because when desgining the prototype, I throught it might be good to show off all the artist invole in the festival but during process of creating website I relize that alot people would know Artwork and not much about artist so I decide just to inclued the Artist info when showing off the artwork. This was the process that undertook when working low-fi prototype phase.
